They will put a shield on the Ancient Fuelweaver rendering him completely invulnerable. They need to be destroyed in order to remove the shield.\n\nLastly, if there is an insane player nearby the Ancient Fuelweaver will try mind controlling them making them unable to do anything for 3.5 seconds.

The Antlion will give 3 warning before that happens. Forming sinkholes destroy structures and damage players. Players can't build on sinkholes and have their movement speed greatly decreased when walking over them.\n\nTo stop the Antlion from becoming enraged players must pay tribute in the form of trinkets which it will eat. As a reward it will give 1 Desert Stone for each trinket.\n\nThe other method of stopping the Antion is to fight and kill it. To do this players must first feed it frozen or burning hot thermal stone, the first one will freeze the Antlion, the latter one will set it on fire.\n\nWhen in combat the Antlion will spawn sand castles around the area where the fight takes place. Its only attack is summoning various sand spikes that grow out of the ground dealing between 50, 75 and 100 dmg (depending on the size of the spike).

The Bearger has the ability to perform a big area of effect attack every 3 basic attacks. When this happens it will charge the player and slam the ground dealing 100 dmg to all players caught in it.
